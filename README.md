# Day 7
1.Use the built-in interfaces included in the java.util.function package such as Predicate, Consumer, Function, and Supplier  
2. Develop code that uses primitive versions of functional interfaces  
3.Develop code that uses binary versions of functional interfaces  
4. Develop code that uses the UnaryOperator interface  
# Day 8
1.Develop code to extract data from an object using peek() and map() methods including primitive versions of the map() method  
2.Search for data by using search methods of the Stream classes including findFirst, findAny, anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch  
3.Develop code that uses the Optional class and Stream data methods and calculation methods  
4.Sort a collection using Stream API  
5.Save results to a collection using the collect method and group/partition data using the Collectors class  
6.Use flatMap() methods in the Stream API
